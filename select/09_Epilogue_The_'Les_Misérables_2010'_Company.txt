Alone I wait in the shadows
I count the hours till I can sleep
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by
It made her weep to know I die.
Alone at the end of the day
Upon this wedding night I pray
Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace
And show them grace.
God on high
Hear my prayer
Take me now
To thy care
Where You are
Let me be
Take me now
Take me there
Bring me home
Bring me home.
M'sieur, I bless your name
M'sieur, lay down your burden
You raised my child in love
And you will be with god.
I am ready, Fantine
At the end of my days
She's the best of my life.
Papa, papa, I do not understand!
Are you alright? They said you'd gone away.
Cosette, my child, am I forgiven now?
Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day.
It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It's you who must forgive a thankless man
It's thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet.
Cosette, your father is a saint.
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home to you!
Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed
You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye.
Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try
On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well
When I at last am sleeping.
It's a story
Of those who always loved you
Your mother gave her life for you
Then gave you to my keeping.
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you.
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy.
Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory.
Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting.
And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God! Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light

For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise.

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
We will walk behind the plough-share
We will put away the sword
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward!

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that we bring
When tomorrow comes!
