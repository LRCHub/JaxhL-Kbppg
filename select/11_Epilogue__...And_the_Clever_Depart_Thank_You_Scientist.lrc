[00:00.00] (Hooh) And you said I could take it or leave it
[00:23.50] 
[00:08.90] We have so many songs still left to sing
[00:12.09] Too many notes for normal folks to understand
[00:15.82] Confirmin' my fears that I threw it all away
[00:21.59] (I threw it, I threw it all away)
[00:23.47] Movin' along, singin' a song
[00:26.94] Is all that I can do
[00:30.64] You take it or leave it (take it or leave it)
[00:34.48] I'll leave it all with you
