[00:00.23] Synapse to synapse
[00:03.36] The possibility's thin
[00:06.45] I'm dressed up for free drinks
[00:09.45] And family greetings
[00:19.45] 
[00:11.50] On your wedding, your wedding
[00:14.66] Your wedding date
[00:17.60] The figures in plastic on the wedding cake
[00:22.99] That I took were so real
[00:34.99] 
[00:36.97] And I kept distance
[00:39.99] The complications cloud
[00:42.97] The postcards
[00:44.52] And blip through fiber optics
[00:59.02] 
[00:48.02] As the girls with pigtails were running
[00:52.87] From little boys wearing bow ties
[00:57.16] Their parents bought them
[00:59.84] "I'll catch you this time"
[01:12.84] 
[01:12.76] Crashing through the parlor doors
[01:17.21] What was your first reaction?
[01:24.86] Screaming, drunk, disorderly
[01:29.38] I'll tell you mine
[01:38.38] 
[01:31.56] You were the one but I can't spit it out
[01:39.65] When the date's been set
[01:43.53] The white routine
[01:47.14] To be ingested inaccurately
[02:00.64] 
[02:10.90] Synapse to synapse
[02:13.69] The sneaky kids had attached
[02:16.95] Beer cans to the bumper so they could drive
[02:22.50] Up and down the main drag
[02:35.00] 
[02:28.33] People would turn
[02:30.58] To see who's
[02:31.71] Making the racket
[02:33.76] It's not the first time
[02:45.26] 
[02:47.25] When they lay down
[02:50.26] The fish will swim upstream
[02:53.42] And I'll contest
[02:56.25] But they won't listen
[03:06.75] 
[02:58.23] When the casualty rate's
[03:00.82] Near 100 percent
[03:04.24] And there isn't a pension
[03:07.70] For second best or for hardly moving
[03:25.70] 
[03:23.20] Crashing through the parlor doors
[03:27.61] What was your first reaction?
[03:35.22] Screaming, drunk, disorderly
[03:39.83] I'll tell you mine
[03:48.83] 
[03:42.09] You were the one, but I can't spit it out
[03:49.88] When the date's been set
[03:54.07] The white routine
[03:57.65] To be ingested inaccurately
[04:11.15] 
[04:45.60] You were the one, but I can't spit it out
[04:54.13] When the date's been set
[04:58.54] The white routine
[05:02.37] To be ingested inaccurately
